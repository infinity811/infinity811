I am a Data Science and AI enthusiast with a strong foundation in Machine Learning, NLP, Generative AI, and Cloud Computing. With hands-on experience in LLM-based text anonymization, AI-generated text detection, and large-scale data engineering, I specialize in building scalable, real-world AI solutions that drive efficiency and automation.

Through my work at Smarsh, I developed an enterprise-level data pipeline, engineered LLM-powered anonymization systems, and fine-tuned cutting-edge NLP models for compliance and regulatory use cases. My expertise spans Python, PyTorch, OpenAI API, LangChain, AWS S3, SQL, and MLOps, with a strong focus on optimizing data workflows and model performance.

Beyond data science, I am a confident leader and communicator, recognized for team-building, problem-solving, and driving large-scale initiatives. My ability to adapt quickly to new technologies allows me to bridge the gap between AI, business impact, and user experience.

Outside of tech, I am an accomplished musician and a professional Western Classical singer, having achieved Fourth Grade from the Trinity School of London. As a YouTuber, I have engaged audiences with 2K+ views, blending my technical and creative pursuits.

I thrive on solving complex challenges, pushing boundaries, and delivering AI-driven innovations that make a tangible difference. I am actively seeking opportunities to leverage my expertise in AI, NLP, and cloud technologies to create impactful solutions.
